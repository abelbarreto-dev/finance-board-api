# Testing Description
This application has the support unit testing, our supplier is the [Jest Project](https://jestjs.io/).

To Run our tests, we've two options of commands:

```commandline
npx jest
```

**OR**

```commandline
npm run test
```

They will find and run all our test cases, and you can see what's happening by console.

Of course, you can configure the **DEBUG** at your IDE using *NODE + [jest.config.ts](/jest.config.ts)* at
project root.
